3. Pustules ( Fig. 24.20b ).
The skin may be very greasy (seborrhoea). Rupture of the 
inﬂamed lesions may lead to deep-seated dermal inﬂamma-tion and nodulocystic lesions, which are more likely to cause facial scarring. A premenstrual exacerbation of acne is some-times noticed. There is a tendency for spontaneous improve-ment over a number of years but acne can persist unabated into adult life.
A number of clinical variants exist:
/H17039 Infantile acne . Facial acne is occasionally seen in 
infants and is sometimes cystic. It is thought to be due to the inﬂuence of maternal androgens and resolves spontaneously.
/H17039 Steroid acne . Acne may occur secondary to 
corticosteroid therapy or Cushing’s syndrome. Clinically the rash often appears as a pustular folliculitis on the trunk without comedones.Facial rashes
