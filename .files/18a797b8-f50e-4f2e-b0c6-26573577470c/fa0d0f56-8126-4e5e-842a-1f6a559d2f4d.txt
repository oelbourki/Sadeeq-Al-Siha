S – Setting
/H17039 See the patient as soon as the current information has 
been gathered.
/H17039 Ask not to be disturbed and hand bleeps to colleagues.
/H17039 If possible, the patient should have someone with them.
/H17039 Choose a quiet place with everyone seated and 
introduce everyone.
/H17039 Indicate your status, extent of your responsibility toward

terms. Check understanding frequently: ‘Is this making 
sense so far?’ before moving on. Watch for signs the patient can take no more.
/H17039 Invite questions.
/H17039 Emphasize which things, for example pain and other
