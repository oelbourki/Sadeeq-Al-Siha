Acne vulgaris (AV), characterized by excessive sebum production and Cutibacterium acnes proliferation in the sebaceous glands, significantly impacts physical and psychological health. Recent treatment advancements have focused on selective photothermolysis of sebaceous glands. This review evaluates two innovative therapies: the 1726-nm laser and nanoparticle-assisted laser treatments. We conducted a comprehensive search of PubMed and Embase using the primary terms "acne vulgaris" or "acne" AND "laser," "photothermal therapy," "nanoparticles," "treatment," or "1726 nm laser." Inclusion criteria were articles published in English in peer-reviewed journals that focused on treating AV through targeting the sebaceous glands, yielding 11Â studies. Gold nanoparticles, used with 800-nm laser, 1064-nm Nd: YAG laser, or photopneumatic device, and platinum nanoparticles with 1450-nm diode laser, showed notable improvements in severity and number of acne lesions, safety, and patient satisfaction. The 1726-nm laser treatments also showed considerable lesion reduction and tolerability, with minimal side effects such as erythema and edema. Its efficiency is credited to its short, high-power pulses that effectively target sebaceous glands, offering precise treatment with fewer side effects compared to lower-power pulses. Selective photothermolysis using nanoparticle-assisted laser therapy or the 1726-nm laser offers a promising alternative to conventional AV treatments, showcasing efficacy and high patient satisfaction. The 1726-nm laser streamlines treatment but involves new equipment costs, while nanoparticle-assisted therapy integrates well into existing setups but relies on external agents and is unsuitable for certain allergies. Future research should include long-term studies and comparative analyses. The choice of treatment modality should consider patient preferences, cost implications, and availability of specific therapies.
