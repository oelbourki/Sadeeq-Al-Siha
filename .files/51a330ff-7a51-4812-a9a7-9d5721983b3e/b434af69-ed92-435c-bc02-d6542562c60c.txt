Post-acne erythema (PAE) is a bothering skin condition that emerges from inflammatory acne and persists after its resolution. It is characterized by telangiectasia and erythematous macules. the role of 1064-nm Nd: YAG when combined with low-dose isotretinoin in the acne erythema treatment. forty-eight PAE patients were involved in the study. They were divided into two groups; group (A) patients administering a low dose of oral isotretinoin (10 mg/day) and underwent a total of six two-week interval sessions of 1064 ND-YAG laser treatment, group (B) patients administering a low dose of oral isotretinoin (10 mg/day) only. All adverse effects experienced during the course of therapy were documented, and photos were taken before the start of the treatment and following the end of the treatment duration. Following the completion of the therapeutic intervention, a significant improvement in clinical condition was observed in both groups, with more improvement in group (A) compared to group (B) as evidenced by a notable improvement in the score on the Clinician Erythema Assessment Scale (CEAS) and also a significant decrease in the mean value of optical density of the erythema. combined 1064-nm Nd: YAG with low-dose isotretinoin may be an efficient and secure line in the PAE treatment. Also, the combined therapy had superior results when compared to low-dose isotretinoin alone.
